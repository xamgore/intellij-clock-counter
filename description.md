#### Description

```
Takes information about downloads of the intellij-clock plugin (with its rivals) and sends it to my personal bot's chat room. 
Example:

Clock:               ⇊2432       ✩3.0  ꆜ4
Clock Widget:  ⇊236   +4  ✩5.0  ꆜ2
Time:                ⇊86             ✩1.0  ꆜ1

Generally this bot is useless, though, you can read the sources and adapt it for your needs: github.com/xamgore/intellij-clock-tracker
